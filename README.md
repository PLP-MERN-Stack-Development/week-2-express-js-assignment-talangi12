# Express.js RESTful API Assignment

This assignment focuses on building a RESTful API using Express.js, implementing proper routing, middleware, and error handling.

## Assignment Overview

You will:
1. Set up an Express.js server
2. Create RESTful API routes for a product resource
3. Implement custom middleware for logging, authentication, and validation
4. Add comprehensive error handling
5. Develop advanced features like filtering, pagination, and search

## Getting Started

1. Accept the GitHub Classroom assignment invitation
2. Clone your personal repository that was created by GitHub Classroom
3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
4. Run the server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

- # Express.js RESTful API

This project builds a RESTful API using Express.js, implementing standard CRUD operations, proper routing, middleware, and comprehensive error handling. It also includes advanced features like filtering, pagination, and search for products.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (v18 or higher recommended)
* npm (Node Package Manager)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <your-github-classroom-repo-link>
    cd express-api-project
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Environment Variables

Create a file named `.env` in the root directory of your project and add the following:


PORT=3000
API_KEY=your-secret-api-key

* `PORT`: The port on which the server will listen.
* `API_KEY`: A secret key required for authenticating requests to the `/api` endpoints.

### Running the Server

To start the server in development mode (with `nodemon` for auto-restarts):

```bash
npm run dev

To start the server in production mode:
npm start

The server will be running on http://localhost:3000 (or the port you configured in .env).
üöÄ API Endpoints Documentation
All API endpoints are prefixed with /api. An X-API-Key header with the value from your .env file (your-secret-api-key by default) is required for all /api endpoints.
